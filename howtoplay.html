    style="float:right;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperial Struggle 3.03</h1>     
<p style="font-size:18px;">
The Imperial Struggle module was created by <b>Joel Toppen</b> and then substantially updated by <b>Brian 
Reynolds</b>. Special thanks to <b>Nix</b> who created the Card Display and made other helpful tweaks.
    
<br><br>The module is presently maintained by <b>Brian 
Reynolds</b> - please report any problems to 
<b>brian@brianreynolds.net</b>. 

<br><br>
    <h2 style="font-size:26px">First Things First</h2><p style="font-size:18px;">
Under the "Help" menu you will find a link to the latest version of the Imperial Struggle rulebook and playbook, in case you are 
still learning how to play the game itself, or just need to "look up a rule". 

<br><br>Meanwhile the rest of this document details how to use this VASSAL module to play Imperial Struggle.

<br><br><img src="how_mats.png">
<h3 style="font-size:22px">1. Starting a game</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">(a) Once you've launched the module and picked a side, the important first step is to open the War of the Spanish Succession screen and from its toolbar click either
          the "Deal French Basic War Tiles" or "Deal British Basic War Tiles" button, whichever is appropriate for your side (or both sides, if you are playing solo). In addition to dealing the 
          initial war tiles, this will give you "ownership" of the side in question by flipping to hidden all of your side(s) Ministry cards using your password. 
          <br><br>
          (b) Next, ONE player (whoever is setting up the game first) should click the "Deal Awards" button on the main toolbar, followed by the "Deal Investment Tiles" button next to it. This will
          randomize the first set of Awards and Global Demand counters, as well as the first set of Investment Tiles.
          <br><br>
          (c) Third, scroll to the bottom of the main map and use the "Draw Card" buttons for your side to draw your first hand of 3 event cards. The faces of the event cards you draw will be hidden
          from other players but visible to you. You can reveal an event card to your opponent either by dragging it onto the mapboard or right-clicking it and selecting an option from the menu.
          <br><br>
          (d) Fourth, open the Ministry for your side using the button on the main toolbar. If the cards aren't already face down, then you forgot to do step (a), but you can still take ownership 
          of your side with the "Flip Cards Face Down" button. You can then choose your starting ministers either by right-clicking them and using the "Select Minister" option, OR by dragging the 
          minister card manually to your Player Mat, which can also be opened from the top toolbar. On your Player Mat you will find your selected ministers (and the option of sending or dragging them
          back to the ministry if needed). Minister cards can be freely dragged between the Player Mat and the Ministry window -- it is up to the players to follow the correct rules for doing so, but
          the Vassal module will provide a log of any changes, automatically update Ministry keyword-related War scores when Ministers are hidden/revealed, and will warn when a move looks like it might
          be incorrect.
          <br><br>
          (e) Once both sides have drawn war tiles and event cards and chosen ministers, and one player has dealt out the Awards/Demands/Investments, you are ready for the French player to decide
          who is going first, and for that player to select their first Investment tile!

          <br><br><img src="how_mats.png">
<h3 style="font-size:22px">2. Taking a turn</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">(a) When it's your turn, you can right-click the Investment Tile of your choice and select it for your side. Although it's allowable under the rules to use other
          systems such as dragging the tile elsewhere, it is recommended at minimum that you also right-click the tile and mark it for your side, as this will improve the automated features of the
          game, plus making it clear who has selected which tiles. 
          <br><br>
          (b) If eligible, you can then play an event card from your hand. The most popular way to do this is to first drag the event card to the middle of the map, which will reveal it to your opponent. Then,
          right-click the event and select "Play Event", which will move the event to the played cards pile (to the left of the main map). At some point during this process you may want to announce to
          your opponent (eg in the chat) whether you qualify for the bonus on the card or not. And then of course resolve the card's effect(s). 
          <br><br>
          (c) If your Investment Tile qualifies you for a war tile upgrade, you can open the appropriate War screen from the toolbar, right-click on one of your Basic War Tiles, and select
          "Replace This Tile". That will deal a new random war tile to the appropriate theater, at which point you can decide which of the two tiles to right-click on and send either back to
          your Player Mat or out of the game at your option.
          <br><br>
          (d) Once your event, if any, has been resolved, you can begin spending action points from your Investment Tile by e.g. flagging/unflagging spaces on the map, activating advantages you control, 
          and so forth.

<br><br><img src="how_mats.png">
<h3 style="font-size:22px">3. Flagging and Unflagging spaces</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">You can right+click on any map space to flag it or unflag it. As of version 3.0, flag markers can now also be dragged around -- either short distances to organize 
          counters, or even to entirely different spaces if desired. When flag markers are dragged around, the appropriate flag counts for regions etc will still be kept properly updated.
          <br><br>
          You can also right+click on a flag marker itself when you wish to e.g. flip or remove it -- it will produce the equivalent menu to clicking on its space.

<br><br> <br><img src="how_cards.png">
<br>
                    <h3 style="font-size:22px">4. Conflict Markers</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">You can right+click on any space (or flag) to add a conflict marker to it, or to remove one if already present. Conflict markers will correctly update the flag counts 
          for regions and wars to account for the Conflict marker's effect on scoring, wars, etc. Note that conflict markers are automatically removed when control of the space changes (flagged, unflagged, etc).

<br><br> <br><img src="how_cards.png">
<br>
                    <h3 style="font-size:22px">5. Squadrons</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">Squadron markers can now be freely dragged around the map, and will properly update flag counts and war strengths whenever you do so. Optionally they can also
          be right-clicked to select the places to deploy them from a menu. You will find the supply of additional squadrons on your Player Mat (accessible through the top toolbar) -- to build a
          squadron you can drag one onto the map from there, or click the "Build 1 Squadron" button in that window's toolbar to send a squadron to the Navy Box. 

          <br><br> <br><img src="how_cards.png">
<br>
                    <h3 style="font-size:22px">6. Advantages</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">Advantage tiles will <i>automatically</i> be sent to the proper player mat when the proper map space(s) are controlled by a side. They will also be automatically
          returned to the map if control is lost. You can find your currently controlled advantages on your Player Mat (accessible via the top toolbar). Right-clicking an Advantage tile will give
          you the option to Exhaust the advantage in order to use its effect.

          <br><br>Rolling over an advantage tile <i>or vacant Advantage location</i> on the map with your mouse will show you both sides of the advantage tile.

<br><br> <br><img src="how_cards.png">
<br>
                    <h3 style="font-size:22px">7. General Records Track</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">Victory Points, Debt, Debt Limits, and Treaty Points are all tracked on the General Records track. The markers can be dragged between spaces as appropriate to
          make adjustments. Right-clicking on a counter will also reveal the hotkeys Ctrl+ and Ctrl- to adjust them upwards or downwards. Changes to marker values will be logged so that it is easy 
          for all players to follow.

          <br><br> <br><img src="how_cards.png">
<br>
          <h3 style="font-size:22px">8. Pieces Window</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">Certain rarer counters (e.g. Atlantic Dominance, Bing, Jacobites, New World Huguenots, Townshend Acts) along with additional Conflict, Exhausted, and Fort Damaged
          counters can be found in the Pieces Window, which you can open from the main toolbar. 

          <h3 style="font-size:22px">9. Flag Counts and Scoring</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">When you are ready to score at the end of a turn, the flag counts displayed in each region's Award Box will show the total flag count of each side--the count also properly
          ignores flags in spaces with a Conflict marker. Go through each region and apply the results by adjusting the Victory Points marker. 

          <br><br>The Global Demand chits similarly display a flag and number showing the side which currently controls that demand, or a 0 if neither side controls it.

          <h3 style="font-size:22px">10. End of Turn</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">When a turn is complete and you have finished scoring, the Game Turn marker can be dragged to the next appropriate space--or if you click to select the marker, the Ctrl+ and Ctrl- hotkeys
          become available to adjust it.

          <h3 style="font-size:22px">11. Wars</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">(a)Each of the four War buttons on the main toolbar opens a window displaying the mat for the corresponding war.
          <br><br>(b) Bonus War Tiles can be purchased on this screen by clicking the appropriate button from the War window's toolbar.
          <br><br>(c) Basic War Tiles can be upgraded by right-clicking them and selecting "Replace This Tile" from the menu. A new tile will be drawn,
          after which you can choose which tile to right-click and send back to your Player Mat or out of the game.
          <br><br>(d) The flag counters next to each region show the current strength of each side based on the "Bonus Strength" box for that region--in other words, the numbers
          take into account all of the flags, squadrons, conflict markers, and minister keywords (from currently revealed ministers). They do NOT presently count the values on the 
          war tiles themselves. 
          <br><br>(e) After you have resolved all of the theaters in a war (perhaps alternating with your opponent in revealing the tiles for the next theater and resolving the effects), it is
          important for each player to open the window for the NEXT war and click the "Deal French Basic War Tiles" or "Deal British Basic War Tiles" button for your side -- this will shuffle the
          basic war tiles and deal them out in preparation for the next war. 

          <h3 style="font-size:22px">12. Starting the Next Peace Turn</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">(a) When a new peace turn starts--either following War resolution or when moving from turn 2 to turn 3, one player should again click the
          Deal Awards button followed by the Deal Investment Tiles buttons on the main toolbar. Then, click the Reset button to remove any Exhausted markers on advantages and
          Ministers, and if a war was just completed, you can click the Remove Conflict button to remove any Conflict markers you have marked as "used in War".
          <br><br>(b) Next, if it is turn 3 or turn 5, add four to each player's Debt Limit, and right-click the new Event Card deck for the new age and select the "Shuffle into Events Deck" option.
          <br><br>(c) Each player draws 3 new event cards.
          <br><br>(d) If it is Turn 3 or Turn 5, players select new Ministers -- return the current ministers from your player mat either by right-clicking them or dragging them back into the Ministry Window, and then
          select new ministers from the Ministry window. If it isn't Turn 3 or Turn 5, then players can still return and replace unrevealed ministers.
          <br><br>(e) Each player discards down to 3 event cards.
          <br><br>(f) Determine who holds the Initiative based on the current Victory Points level, and if needed flip the Initiative Marker. The player with Initiative decides who goes first for the turn.

          <h3 style="font-size:22px">13. Cards Display</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">The Cards button on the main toolbar opens a Card Display window which shows the text of every card in the game, for reference purposes. 











<br><br> <br><img src="how_tuck.png">
<br>
                    <h3 style="font-size:22px">3. Arts of War Cards</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">Just below the main decks are the Arts of War "hands" for each player. Clicking one
          of the "Draw" buttons will draw a card -- note that it will remain masked/hidden from your opponent until you 
          either play it (or manually "flip it over" e.g. with Ctrl+F). These buttons can be used for randomly drawing
          events, and the card slots can also be used to retain held events. 
          <br><br>

          Right+Clicking on an Arts of War deck will bring up the "Draw Specific Cards" menu when you need to sort through
          the deck to find a particular capability. Select the card(s) you want from the menu, click Okay, and then drag from
          the top of the deck to pick the card you want.
          <br><br>

          Discarded Events can be reshuffled into the Arts of War deck by right+clicking the discard pile. Dragging a card
          directly into the Arts of War draw pile also automatically "shuffles it in" -- the next time you draw a card it
          will be a random one.
          <br><br>

          By dragging them to the appropriate position, Arts of War cards can be tucked underneath a Lord's Mat (e.g. to 
          give him a Capability). They can also be tucked under the bottom edge of the map board in the case of All Lords 
          capabilities. 
          <br><br>

<br><br> <br><img src="how_plan.png">
<br>
<h3 style="font-size:22px">4. Command Cards</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">Although all of the Command Cards also begin the game in their respective decks below the 
          map, you will of course need to organize them into a plan each turn. To make your plan, first open the Planning screen
          for your side by clicking the appropriate button on the toolbar (or by pressing Alt+C if you are playing the Christians 
          or Alt+M if you are playing the Muslims). Next, click the "Click to Start a New Plan" button--this will summon all of your side's
          Command Cards to this window and organize them into appropriate piles by Lord. Then, drag a Command Card into each of
          the planning slots -- eight if a summer turn, seven otherwise. While planning you can freely drag the cards around the
          screen.
          <br><br>
          Once you are satisfied with your plan, click the "Click To Send Plan to Deck" button. The cards you selected by placing
          them in the planning slots will now be sent to your side's deck on the main screen, all the the proper order (the card
          you put in the "1st Card" slot will be the top card of the deck, the "2nd Card" will be the next card, etc). You may now
          close the planning window, as you will not need it again until next turn.
          <br><br>
          Back on the main map screen, you can right+click the Command Card deck when you are ready to draw your next Command Card; 
          or alternatively you can manually drag it off yourself: either way will reveal and announce it.
          <br><br>
          When the turn is over and it is time to construct a new plan for the next turn, simply repeat these steps--when you again
          click the "Click to Start a New Plan" button on your planning screen, all of your Command Cards will be returned to the
          planning screen and reorganized, etc.

<br><br> <br><img src="how_cylinder.png">
<br>
              <h3 style="font-size:22px">5. Lord Cylinders</h3>

              <p style="font-size:18px;">When you start a scenario, the Lord Cylinders will be distributed appropriately around
              the map and on the Calendar. Right+clicking a Lord's Cylinder will bring up a context menu for relevant Lord actions.
              In particular, a Lord can be <b>mustered</b> from this menu (or pressing Ctrl+M with the cylinder selected)--this will
              automatically add the Lord's Mat to his side's main area (the Mat can then optionally be sent to the Hidden Lords screen
              if playing with those rules). Likewise, a Lord can be <b>disbanded</b> from his cylinder's right+click context menu.
              Disbanding a Lord will automatically remove his Lord Mat (and its contents), and will send his Lord Cylinder to the
              appropriate space on the Calendar.
              <br><br>
              <b>Note:</b> It is presently up to the players to determine if a Lord is being disbanded past his Service limit
              and therefore should be removed from play. The option to remove a Lord from the game is also present on his Cylinder's 
              context menu--or the Cylinder can be dragged manually to the Removed From Game window.

<br><br> <br><img src="how_service.png">
<br>
              <h3 style="font-size:22px">6. Service Markers</h3>

              <p style="font-size:18px;">When a Lord is mustered, his Service Marker is automatically placed on the Calendar. The
              Service Marker can then be dragged from space to space on the Calendar as shifts are called for during play. Right+clicking
              a Service Marker will open a context menu which provides an alternate way to <b>disband</b> or <b>remove</b> a Lord and
              his Lord Mat.

<br><br> <br><img src="how_vassals.png">
<br>
              <h3 style="font-size:22px">7. Vassal Service Markers</h3>

              <p style="font-size:18px;">Service Markers for <b>Vassals</b> appear on their Lord's Mat when the Lord is mustered. 
              Right+Clicking a Vassal's Service Marker will provide the option to <b>muster that Vassal</b> (or Ctrl+M with the 
              Service Marker selected), which will place the appropriate troops on the Lord's Mat. If playing with the <b>advanced 
              Vassal rules</b>, you can instead select the advanced mustering option (or Alt+M with the Service Marker selected) to
              both place the troops and send the Vassal's Service Marker to the appropriate space on the Calendar. Once on the 
              Calendar, the Service Marker's menu will now include the option to <b>disband</b> the Vassal (returning the marker to
              the Lord's Mat) or to remove that Vassal from the game if he is past his Service limit. 
              <br><br>
              <b>Note:</b> Disbanding a Vassal (e.g. from his Service Marker's context menu) does <i>not</i> automatically remove
              any forces from the Lord's Mat--that is up to players to determine. Likewise it is presently up to the players to
              determine if the Vassal is past his Service limit and must therefore be removed from the game. 

              
<br><br> <br><img src="how_levy.png">
<br>
              <h3 style="font-size:22px">8. Levy/Campaign</h3>
<p style="font-size:18px;">The Levy/Campaign marker can be freely dragged around the Calendar to adjust the current turn. Right+Click
the Levy/Campaign marker (or press Ctrl+F with the marker selected) to flip it between the Levy and Campaign sides. Dragging the marker
to a new turn will automatically flip it back to Levy.

<br><br> <br><img src="how_vp.png">
<br>
              <h3 style="font-size:22px">9. Victory Points and Markers</h3>
<p style="font-size:18px;">The two Victory markers will automatically move whenever their side's score changes due to the
addition or removal of a Conquered, Ravaged, Jihad, or Cathedral marker. It will likewise move automatically when a Taifa's
status changes between Independent, Parias, and Reconquista. Players may also at their discretion drag and/or flip a Victory 
marker to make manual VP adjustments.

<br><br> <br><img src="how_map.png">
<br>
              <h3 style="font-size:22px">10. Map Locations</h3>
<p style="font-size:18px;">Right+clicking a map location will produce a context menu useful for adding additional markers
to that location during play. When you add a marker in this way, it will appear at the location you originally right+clicked.
<br><br>

If you have the map zoomed out, hovering over a location with the mouse will produce a tooltip window showing the details
of the space--this can be useful for decoding the smalls symbols on the map while zoomed out. Note that the map Legend can
also be hovered over in this way.


                        <br><br> <br><img src="ABB Event Cards - BACKS-1917.png" width="71" height="100"<br>
              <h3 style="font-size:22px">11. Battle Array and Battle Mat</h3>
<p style="font-size:18px;">Just like the actual Almoravid boardgame, this module offers the option to resolve battles
either by making a full-size Battle Array out of the relevant Lord Mats, or to use the Lord Cylinders on the smaller 
Battle Mat. 
<br><br>

<br><br> <br><img src="how_array.png">
<br>
              <h3 style="font-size:22px">12. Battle Array</h3>
<p style="font-size:18px;">The full-size Battle Array can be found at the very bottom of the main map screen, down below
the Arts of War card slots. Lord Mats can either be teleported there via the "Send To" submenu on their Mats' right+click
context menus, or they can be dragged there manually. Shortcut keys are also available--Ctrl+L to send a Lord to the left 
of the array, Ctrl+C for Center, Ctrl+R for Right, and Ctrl+V for Reserve. If the "Send To" option is used, the Lord Mat 
will be automatically rotated into an appropriate facing; rotation can also be applied manually, either from the right+click menu or by pressing
Ctrl+[ and Ctrl+] with the Lord Mat selected. The "Send To" menu can likewise be used to send Lords back to either the
main area (Ctrl+A) or the Hidden Lords area (Ctrl+H); again, using "Send To" will automatically restore the Lord Mat's
default rotation.
<br><br>
Right+Clicking near the "Battle Array" label will produce a context menu to allow the easy addition of a <b>Pursuit Marker</b>,
additional <b>troops</b>, and so forth.

<br><br> <br><img src="how_battle_mat.png">
<br>
              <h3 style="font-size:22px">13. Battle Mat</h3>
<p style="font-size:18px;">The Battle Mat can be opened from the module's toolbar or by pressing Alt+Shift+B. Once open,
Lord Cylinders can be dragged directly into the window during resolution of the battle. 
<br><br>

Right+Clicking anywhere on the Battle Mat window will produce a context menu to allow the easy addition of a <b>Pursuit Marker</b>,
additional <b>troops</b>, and so forth.


<br><br> <br><img src="how_palette.png">
<br>
              <h3 style="font-size:22px">14. Piece Palette</h3>
<p style="font-size:18px;">A traditional VASSAL Piece Palette is provided as an alternative way of adding forces, 
assets, VP markers, and other sundry markers. There is no difference in game effect between markers dragged into the
game from the palette and those added from e.g. context menus--use of one or the other is simply a matter of player
convenience. 
<br><br>
Note that certain esoteric markers can <i>only</i> be added from context menus--these include the Pursuit Marker (add by
right+clicking Battle Array label, or anywhere on the Battle Mat). Likewise Service Markers appear automatically, and only
when the appropriate Lord is mustered.


<br><br> <br><img src="how_remove.png">
<br>
              <h3 style="font-size:22px">15. Removing Pieces From Game</h3>
<p style="font-size:18px;">When the rules call for a piece to be removed from the game, you can drag it to the
Removed From Game screen, which can be opened from the module's toolbar or by pressing Alt+R. Individual Lords and
Service Markers can also be sent directly to the Removed From Game screen by using their context menus. Accidentally-removed pieces
can be returned to the game either by dragging them back manually or in most cases by right+clicking them.

<br><br> <br><img src="how_aids.png">
<br>
