    style="float:right;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperial Struggle 3.1</h1>     
<p style="font-size:18px;">
The Imperial Struggle module was created by <b>Joel Toppen</b> and then substantially updated by <b>Brian 
Reynolds</b>. Special thanks to <b>Nix</b> who created the Card Display and made other helpful tweaks.
    
<br><br>The module is presently maintained by <b>Brian 
Reynolds</b> - please report any problems to 
<b>brian@brianreynolds.net</b>. 

<br><br>
    <h2 style="font-size:26px">First Things First</h2><p style="font-size:18px;">
Under the "Help" menu you will find a link to the latest version of the Imperial Struggle rulebook and playbook, in case you are 
still learning how to play the game itself, or just need to "look up a rule". 

<br><br>Meanwhile the rest of this document details how to use this VASSAL module to play Imperial Struggle.

<br><br><img src="HowIntro.png"><br>  
<h3 style="font-size:22px">1. Starting a game</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">(a) Once you've launched the module and picked a side, the important first step is to open the War of the Spanish Succession screen and from its toolbar click either
          the "Deal French Basic War Tiles" or "Deal British Basic War Tiles" button, whichever is appropriate for your side (or both sides, if you are playing solo). In addition to dealing the 
          initial war tiles, this will give you "ownership" of the side in question by flipping to hidden all of your side(s) Ministry cards using your password. 
          <br><br><img src="HowStart.png"><br><br>
          (b) Next, ONE player (whoever is setting up the game first) should click the "Deal Awards" button on the main toolbar, followed by the "Deal Investment Tiles" button next to it. This will
          randomize the first set of Awards and Global Demand counters, as well as the first set of Investment Tiles.
          <br><br><img src="HowStart2.png"><br><br>
          (c) Third, scroll to the bottom of the main map and use the "Draw Card" buttons for your side to draw your first hand of 3 event cards. The faces of the event cards you draw will be hidden
          from other players but visible to you. You can reveal an event card to your opponent either by dragging it onto the mapboard or right-clicking it and selecting an option from the menu.
          <br><br><img src="HowStart3.png"><br><br>
          (d) Fourth, open the Ministry for your side using the button on the main toolbar. If the cards aren't already face down, then you forgot to do step (a), but you can still take ownership 
          of your side with the "Flip Cards Face Down" button. You can then choose your starting ministers either by right-clicking them and using the "Select Minister" option, OR by dragging the 
          minister card manually to your Player Mat, which can also be opened from the top toolbar. On your Player Mat you will find your selected ministers (and the option of sending or dragging them
          back to the ministry if needed). Minister cards can be freely dragged between the Player Mat and the Ministry window -- it is up to the players to follow the correct rules for doing so, but
          the Vassal module will provide a log of any changes, automatically update Ministry keyword-related War scores when Ministers are hidden/revealed, and will warn when a move looks like it might
          be incorrect.
          <br><br><img src="HowStart4.png"><br><br>
          (e) Once both sides have drawn war tiles and event cards and chosen ministers, and one player has dealt out the Awards/Demands/Investments, you are ready for the French player to decide
          who is going first, and for that player to select their first Investment tile!


          <br><br><img src="HowStart5.png"><br>
<h3 style="font-size:22px">2. Taking a turn</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">(a) When it's your turn, you can right-click the Investment Tile of your choice and select it for your side. Although it's allowable under the rules to use other
          systems such as dragging the tile elsewhere, it is recommended at minimum that you also right-click the tile and mark it for your side, as this will improve the automated features of the
          game, plus making it clear who has selected which tiles. 
          <br><br><img src="HowInvest.png"><br><br>
          (b) If eligible, you can then play an event card from your hand. The most popular way to do this is to first drag the event card to the middle of the map, which will reveal it to your opponent. Then,
          right-click the event and select "Play Event", which will move the event to the played cards pile (to the left of the main map) -- note that there is a separate Discard Pile for discarded events, 
          as those might conceivably be shuffled in again, whereas the "Played" events pile is out of the game permanently. At some point during this process you may want to announce to
          your opponent (eg in the chat) whether you qualify for the bonus on the card or not. And then of course resolve the card's effect(s). 
          <br><br><img src="HowEvent.png"><br><br>
          (c) If your Investment Tile qualifies you for a war tile upgrade, you can open the appropriate War screen from the toolbar, right-click on one of your Basic War Tiles, and select
          "Draw Military Upgrade". That will deal a new random war tile to the appropriate theater, at which point you can decide which of the two tiles to right-click on and send either back to
          your Player Mat or out of the game at your option.
          <br><br><img src="HowUpgrade.png"><br><br>
          (d) Once your event, if any, has been resolved, you can begin spending action points from your Investment Tile by e.g. flagging/unflagging spaces on the map, activating advantages you control, 
          and so forth.

<br><br><img src="HowAction.png"><br>
<h3 style="font-size:22px">3. Flagging and Unflagging spaces</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">You can right+click on any map space to flag it or unflag it. As of version 3.0, flag markers can now also be dragged around -- either short distances to organize 
          counters, or even to entirely different spaces if desired. When flag markers are dragged around, the appropriate flag counts for regions etc will still be kept properly updated.
          <br><br>
          You can also right+click on a flag marker itself when you wish to e.g. flip or remove it -- it will produce the equivalent menu to clicking on its space.

<br><br> <br><img src="HowFlag1.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="HowFlag2.png">
<br><br>
                    <h3 style="font-size:22px">4. Conflict Markers</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">You can right+click on any space (or flag) to add a conflict marker to it, or to remove one if already present. Conflict markers will correctly update the flag counts 
          for regions and wars to account for the Conflict marker's effect on scoring, wars, etc. Note that conflict markers are automatically removed when control of the space changes (flagged, unflagged, etc).
          When the Game Turn marker is moved into a War turn space, all conflicts used in that war are automatically marked "Used in War". When the Game Turn marker is moved from a War turn space to a peace
          turn space, all conflicts currently marked "Used in War" are automatically removed.

<br><br> <br><img src="HowConflict.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="HowConflict2.png">
<br><br>
                    <h3 style="font-size:22px">5. Squadrons</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">Squadron markers can now be freely dragged around the map, and will properly update flag counts and war strengths whenever you do so. Optionally they can also
          be right-clicked to select the places to deploy them from a menu. You will find the supply of additional squadrons on your Player Mat (accessible through the top toolbar) -- to build a
          squadron you can drag one onto the map from there, or click the "Build 1 Squadron" button in that window's toolbar to send a squadron to the Navy Box. 
          
           <br><img src="HowSquadron.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="HowSquadron2.png">
<br><br>
                    <h3 style="font-size:22px">6. Advantages</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">Advantage tiles will <i>automatically</i> be sent to the proper player mat when the proper map space(s) are controlled by a side. They will also be automatically
          returned to the map if control is lost. You can find your currently controlled advantages on your Player Mat (accessible via the top toolbar). Right-clicking an Advantage tile will give
          you the option to Exhaust the advantage in order to use its effect.

          <br><br>Rolling over an advantage tile <i>or vacant Advantage location</i> on the map with your mouse will show you both sides of the advantage tile.

<br><br> <br><img src="HowAdvantage.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="HowAdvantage2.png">
<br><br>
                    <h3 style="font-size:22px">7. General Records Track</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">Victory Points, Debt, Debt Limits, and Treaty Points are all tracked on the General Records track. The markers can be dragged between spaces as appropriate to
          make adjustments. Right-clicking on a counter will also reveal the hotkeys Ctrl+ and Ctrl- to adjust them upwards or downwards. Changes to marker values will be logged so that it is easy 
          for all players to follow.

          <br> <br><img src="HowRecords.png">
<br><br>
          <h3 style="font-size:22px">8. Pieces Window</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">Certain rarer counters (e.g. Atlantic Dominance, Bing, Jacobites, New World Huguenots, Townshend Acts) along with additional Conflict, Exhausted, and Fort Damaged
          counters can be found in the Pieces Window, which you can open from the main toolbar. 

          <br><br> <img src="HowPalette.png"><br>

          <h3 style="font-size:22px">9. Flag Counts and Scoring</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">When you are ready to score at the end of a turn, the flag counts displayed in each region's Award Box will show the total flag count of each side--the count also properly
          ignores flags in spaces with a Conflict marker. Go through each region and apply the results by adjusting the Victory Points marker. 

          <br><br>The Global Demand chits similarly display a flag and number showing the side which currently controls that demand, or a 0 if neither side controls it.

          <br><br> <img src="HowCount.png"><br><br>

          <h3 style="font-size:22px">10. End of Turn</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">When a turn is complete and you have finished scoring, the Game Turn marker can be dragged to the next appropriate space--or if you click to select the marker, the Ctrl+ and Ctrl- hotkeys
          become available to adjust it. Note that if you are about to resolve a War turn, it is recommended that you move the Game Turn marker into the appropriate War turn space, as this will cause all
          of the Conflicts used in that war to be automatically marked "Used in War". When the Game Turn marker is then moved onward to the next peace turn, the "Used in War" Conflict markers will automatically be
          removed.

          <br><br> <img src="HowTurn.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="HowTurn2.png"><br><br>

          <h3 style="font-size:22px">11. Wars</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">(a)Each of the four War buttons on the main toolbar opens a window displaying the mat for the corresponding war.
          <br><br>(b) Bonus War Tiles can be purchased on this screen by clicking the appropriate button from the War window's toolbar.
          <br><br>(c) Basic War Tiles can be upgraded by right-clicking them and selecting "Replace This Tile" from the menu. A new tile will be drawn,
          after which you can choose which tile to right-click and send back to your Player Mat or out of the game.
          <br><br>(d) The flag counters next to each region show the current strength of each side based on the "Bonus Strength" box for that region--in other words, the numbers
          take into account all of the flags, squadrons, conflict markers, and minister keywords (from currently revealed ministers). They do NOT presently count the values on the 
          war tiles themselves. 
          <br><br>(e) After you have resolved all of the theaters in a war (perhaps alternating with your opponent in revealing the tiles for the next theater and resolving the effects), it is
          important for each player to open the window for the NEXT war and click the "Deal French Basic War Tiles" or "Deal British Basic War Tiles" button for your side -- this will shuffle the
          basic war tiles and deal them out in preparation for the next war. 
          <br><br>In the image below, France wins the theater by a net of 3 (5 to 2).

          <br><br><img src="HowWar.png"><br><br>

          <h3 style="font-size:22px">12. Starting the Next Peace Turn</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">(a) When a new peace turn starts--either following War resolution or when moving from turn 2 to turn 3, one player should advance the Game Turn marker and then again click the
          Deal Awards button followed by the Deal Investment Tiles buttons on the main toolbar. Then, click the Reset button to remove any Exhausted markers on advantages and
          Ministers, and if a war was just completed, you can click the Remove Conflict button to remove any Conflict markers you have marked as "Used in War" (note that if you
          previously moved the Game Turn marker into the War's triangular space on the turn track, the Conflict markers relevant to that War will already have been automatically
          marked "Used in War", and when you then advance the Game Turn marker to the next peace turn all "Used in War" Conflict markers will automatically be removed. 
          <br><br>(b) Next, if it is turn 3 or turn 5, add four to each player's Debt Limit, and right-click the new Event Card deck for the new age and select the "Shuffle into Events Deck" option.
          <br><br>(c) Each player draws 3 new event cards.
          <br><br>(d) If it is Turn 3 or Turn 5, players select new Ministers -- return the current ministers from your player mat either by right-clicking them or dragging them back into the Ministry Window, and then
          select new ministers from the Ministry window. If it isn't Turn 3 or Turn 5, then players can still return and replace unrevealed ministers.
          <br><br>(e) Each player discards down to 3 event cards.
          <br><br>(f) Determine who holds the Initiative based on the current Victory Points level, and if needed flip the Initiative Marker. The player with Initiative decides who goes first for the turn.

          <br><br><img src="HowNext.png"><br><br>

          <h3 style="font-size:22px">13. Cards Display</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">The Cards button on the main toolbar opens a Card Display window which shows the text of every card in the game, for reference purposes. You can roll over any card
          with the mouse to zoom in on its full text.

          <br><br><img src="HowCardDisplay.png"><br><br>

          <h3 style="font-size:22px">14. Special Module Preferences</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">This module features several special user preferences. To reach them, go to the <i>File</i> menu, select <i>Preferences...</i>, and then select the <i>Imperial Struggle</i> tab.

          <ul style="font-size:18px;">
            <li><b>Show Advantage tiles face up by default</b>: if selected, advantage tiles are by default shown to you "face up" rather than "face down". Changing this preference will immediately
              invert the tiles on the map, and will <b><i>not</i></b> affect the view your opponent sees.</li>
            <li><b>Keep Territory names uncovered when placing flags</b>: if selected, then when a Territory is flagged or reflagged, the flag marker will gravitate to the top of the territory space,
              so that the name of the territory remains in view. Otherwise the flag will gravitate to the center of the space.</li>
            <li><b>Pieces snap to map spaces when first moved from elsewhere</b>: if selected, then when a piece (flag, squadron, advantage, etc) is first moved to a different space, it will "snap to"
              the center of that space. Subsequently moving it <i>within the same space</i> will allow it to be adjusted away from the center. Otherwise (i.e. if this preference is not selected), then 
              most pieces will not snap to the center of spaces at all. Changing this preference changes what happens when <i>you</i> drag pieces; it does not have any effect on what happens when your
              opponents drag them, as that is controlled by their own preference setting.</li>
            <li><b>Display Flag Counts "Light-on-Dark"</b>: if selected, flag counts will be displayed Light-on-Dark; otherwise they will be displayed Dark-on-Light.</li>
          </ul>

          <br><img src="HowPrefs.png"><br>
