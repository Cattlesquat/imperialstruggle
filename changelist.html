== Imperial Struggle 3.0 ==
Ministry Cards can be freely dragged, and will not mess up flag counts, etc. 
Flags (aka Control Markers) can be freely dragged from space to space, and will not mess up flag counts, etc.
Squadrons can be freely dragged from space to face, and will still maintain proper flag counts, etc.
Rollovers for Advantage tiles improved, including showing both sides of the tile
Rollovers for map spaces improved (shows the space itself, so you don't have to blank every counter on the map to see beneath one)
Reorganized space names and zones to make log reporting easier to read
Hotkeys made more consistent (e.g. Ctrl+F should always flip, not "sometimes send to French Player Mat"). BTW, Shift+F is now the send-to-French-Player-Mat hotkey.
Preference added (see Imperial Struggle tab in preferences) to show Advantages face up by default (changing the preference doesn't affect what your opponent sees, so you can use face-up advantages w/o needing to agree with opponent)
Preference added for control markers in Territory spaces to avoid covering up the Territory name by default. Your preference only affects what happens when you add/move control markers (your opponent gets own preference when they take actions) 
Preference added for pieces (eg Control Markers, Squadrons) to "snap to" their spaces when first dragged there (they can still be later adjusted within/near the space). Or if unchecked they never snap. Your preference does not affect what happens when your opponent drags pieces (they get own snap/don't-snap preferenc)
Preference added to display flag counts (in the Award boxes and on War mats) in more attractive Light-on-Dark format instead of Dark-on-Light. Your preference does not affect what your opponent sees. 
VP / TRP / Debt / Debt Limit tokens have hotkeys to move them, and snap to their track spaces to create less mess. Color coding and formatting for their messages to make log clearer.
TURN marker has hotkeys to advance/de-advance it.
Fixed missing Ministry Card in Card Display (two cards had same coordinates)
Added additional border around right & lower edge of map (helps avoid ugly white areas)
Cards no longer appear "behind counters" when dragged onto the map
Better status messages in chat window (e.g. appropriate bolding, color coding, easier to notice key events like opposing Minister revealed)
Ministry Cards still in the Ministry self-organize if you drag them around (so they don't block each other)
Advantage tiles automatically spread out when sent to Player Mats (so don't all go on same spot)
