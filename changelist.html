Fixed missing Ministry Card in Card Display (two cards had same coordinates)
Added additional border around right & lower edge of map (helps avoid ugly white areas)
Reorganized space names and zones to make log reporting easier to read
Cards no longer appear "behind counters" when dragged onto the map
Better status messages in chat window (e.g. easier to notice key events like opposing Minister revealed)
Ministry Cards can be freely dragged, and will not mess up flag counts, etc. 
Ministry Cards still in the Ministry self-organize if you drag them around (so they don't block each other)
Preference added to have Advantage tiles display face up by default (see "Imperial Struggle" tab in preferences - two different players can have opposite preference set & will work)
Advantage tiles automatically spread out when sent to Player Mats (so don't all go on same spot) 
Rollovers for Advantage tiles improved, including showing both sides of the tile
Hotkeys made more consistent (e.g. Ctrl+F should always flip, not "sometimes send to French Player Mat"). BTW, Shift+F is now the send-to-French-Player-Mat hotkey.
