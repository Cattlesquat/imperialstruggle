<h1>Imperial Struggle Vassal Module Changelist</h1>
<h2>3.0 Changelist</h2>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul style="margin-top:-20px;">
  <li>Map spaces can be clicked/selected within their entire boundaries (not just central square). Square artifacts removed from map art.</li>
  <li>Advantage tiles auto-move to and from player mats depending on control of their key spaces. They can still be moved manually.</li>
  <li>Ministry Cards can be freely dragged, and will not mess up flag counts, etc. </li>
  <li>Flags (aka Control Markers) can be freely dragged from space to space, and will not mess up flag counts, etc.</li>
  <li>Squadrons can be freely dragged from space to face, and will still maintain proper flag counts, etc.</li>
  <li>Rollovers for Advantage tiles improved, including showing both sides of the tile</li>
  <li>Rollovers for map spaces improved (shows the space itself, so you don't have to blank every counter on the map to see beneath one)</li>
  <li>Reorganized space names and zones to make log reporting easier to read</li>
  <li>Hotkeys made more consistent (e.g. Ctrl+F should always flip, not "sometimes send to French Player Mat"). BTW, Shift+F is now the send-to-French-Player-Mat hotkey.</li>
  <li>Preference added (see Imperial Struggle tab in preferences) to show Advantages face up by default (changing the preference doesn't affect what your opponent sees, so you can use face-up advantages w/o needing to agree with opponent)</li>
  <li>Preference added for control markers in Territory spaces to avoid covering up the Territory name by default. Your preference only affects what happens when you add/move control markers (your opponent gets own preference when they take actions) </li>
  <li>Preference added for pieces (eg Control Markers, Squadrons) to "snap to" their spaces when first dragged there (they can still be later adjusted within/near the space). Or if unchecked they never snap. Your preference does not affect what happens when your opponent drags pieces (they get own snap/don't-snap preferenc)</li>
  <li>Preference added to display flag counts (in the Award boxes and on War mats) in more attractive Light-on-Dark format instead of Dark-on-Light. Your preference does not affect what your opponent sees. </li>
  <li>VP / TRP / Debt / Debt Limit tokens have hotkeys to move them, and snap to their track spaces to create less mess. Color coding and formatting for their messages to make log clearer.</li>
  <li>TURN marker has hotkeys to advance/de-advance it.</li>
  <li>Fixed missing Ministry Card in Card Display (two cards had same coordinates)</li>
  <li>Added additional border around right & lower edge of map (helps avoid ugly white areas)</li>
  <li>Cards no longer appear "behind counters" when dragged onto the map</li>
  <li>Better status messages in chat window (e.g. appropriate bolding, color coding, easier to notice key events like opposing Minister revealed)</li>
  <li>Ministry Cards still in the Ministry self-organize if you drag them around (so they don't block each other)</li>
  <li>Advantage tiles automatically spread out when sent to Player Mats (so don't all go on same spot) </li>
</ul>
